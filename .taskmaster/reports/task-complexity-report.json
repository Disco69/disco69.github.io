		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Tailwind CSS Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Project Setup and Tailwind CSS Configuration' into: Next.js project initialization with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS installation and configuration, and basic layout/global styles setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard setup procedures. While essential, it's well-documented and typically straightforward. The complexity comes from ensuring all configurations are correct and integrated properly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Define Core Data Models' into: Defining individual TypeScript interfaces for Income, Expense, Goal, and Forecast, and then defining the overarching UserPlan interface that aggregates these.",
			"reasoning": "Defining TypeScript interfaces is a fundamental and relatively low-complexity task. The main effort is ensuring correct types and relationships, which is a one-time definition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Global State Management (React Context)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Implement Global State Management (React Context)' into: Designing the context structure and initial state, implementing the context provider with `useReducer`, defining and implementing state update actions (e.g., add, update, delete for each model), integrating initial data loading/saving mechanisms, and creating custom hooks for context consumption.",
			"reasoning": "This is a core architectural task. Implementing global state management correctly, especially with `useReducer` and ensuring all CRUD operations are handled, requires careful design and implementation. It's foundational for all subsequent data-driven features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Income Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Develop Income Management Module' into: Designing the UI for income input and display, implementing the add income form and validation, implementing edit/delete functionality for existing income, and integrating with the FinancialContext for state updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves UI development, form handling, validation, and integration with the global state. It's a standard CRUD module, but requires attention to user experience and data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Expense Tracking Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Develop Expense Tracking Module' into: Designing the UI for expense input and display, implementing the add expense form with category/due date/recurring fields and validation, implementing edit/delete functionality for existing expenses, and integrating with the FinancialContext for state updates.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to income management, but with slightly more complex fields (category, due date, recurring) which adds a bit more complexity to form handling and data representation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Financial Goals Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Implement Financial Goals Module' into: Designing the UI for goal input and display, implementing the add goal form with progress tracking fields and validation, implementing edit/delete functionality for existing goals, and integrating with the FinancialContext for state updates and progress calculation.",
			"reasoning": "This module involves CRUD operations similar to income/expenses, but also includes the logic for calculating and displaying progress towards a goal, which adds a layer of calculation complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Dashboard Overview",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Develop Dashboard Overview' into: Designing the dashboard layout and components, fetching and calculating key financial metrics (balance, total income/expenses) from context, and displaying goal progress and summaries.",
			"reasoning": "The dashboard is primarily a display component, consuming data from the global state and performing simple aggregations. The complexity lies in presenting the information clearly and accurately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Financial Forecast",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Implement Financial Forecast' into: Designing the forecast calculation algorithm (considering recurring income/expenses and goal impact), implementing the forecast utility function, integrating the forecast data with the UI (e.g., table or simple chart), and ensuring dynamic updates based on data changes.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves significant business logic for financial projections. Accurately calculating future balances based on various inputs (recurring, one-time, goals) requires careful algorithm design and implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Monthly Suggestions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Develop Monthly Suggestions' into: Defining rules/logic for generating suggestions based on forecast and goal progress, implementing the suggestion generation utility, designing the UI for displaying suggestions, and integrating with the forecast and financial context.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing 'smart' logic based on the financial data and forecast. While not as mathematically complex as the forecast itself, designing effective and relevant suggestions requires careful consideration of user scenarios and financial principles."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Save and Load Financial Plan",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Implement Save and Load Financial Plan' into: Implementing data serialization to JSON/CSV, implementing file download functionality, implementing file upload parsing (JSON/CSV), and integrating load functionality with the FinancialContext to update state.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves file I/O operations within the browser, which can be tricky. Handling different formats (JSON/CSV), ensuring data integrity during serialization/deserialization, and managing browser download/upload mechanisms adds significant complexity."
