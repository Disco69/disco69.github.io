# Personal Finance Planner

> **Note:** This is a fun personal project made to solve my own pain in planning my financial situation. Built over a weekend, 100% of code are built by AI using [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), Claude 4 Sonnet, and [Taskmaster](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master). **Hope this helps anyone!**
